## [Unreleased]
### Added
- **Interactive Editor**: A new `hum edit` subcommand that launches a terminal-based editor.
    - **Convenient Composition**: Shortcuts for adding, deleting, and transposing notes.
    - **Live Playback**: Play the current file or start playback from the cursor position.
    - **Vim-like Navigation**: Supports Normal and Insert modes for efficient score editing.
    - **Automatic Formatting**: Vertically aligns notes based on duration and applies styling.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Added unit and integration tests for parsing, transposition, frequency math, and duration logic.

### Changed
- **Code Cleanup**: Refactored internal logic for better modularity and maintainability.

### Fixed
- **Music Theory Correction**: Updated dotted note duration logic. Each subsequent dot now correctly adds half the value of the previous dot (geometric series) rather than a fixed 50% of the base value.
